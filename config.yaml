options:
  loglevel:
    type: int
    default: 1
    description: Mon and OSD debug level. Max is 20.
  use-syslog:
    type: boolean
    default: False
    description: |
      If set to True, supporting services will log to syslog.

    default:
    description: |
      Optional configuration to support use of additional sources such as:
      .
        - ppa:myteam/ppa
        - cloud:xenial-proposed/ocata
        - http://my.archive.com/ubuntu main
      .
      The last option should be used in conjunction with the key configuration
      option.
  key:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      Key ID to import to the apt keyring to support use with arbitary source
      configuration from outside of Launchpad archives or PPA's.
  harden:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      Apply system hardening. Supports a space-delimited list of modules
      to run. Supported modules currently include os, ssh, apache and mysql.
  fsid:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      The unique identifier (fsid) of the Ceph cluster.
      .
      To generate a suitable value use `uuidgen`.
      If left empty, an fsid will be generated.
      .
      NOTE: Changing this configuration after deployment is not supported and
      new service units will not be able to join the cluster.
  config-flags:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      User provided Ceph configuration. Supports a string representation of
      a python dictionary where each top-level key represents a section in
      the ceph.conf template. You may only use sections supported in the
      template.
      .
      WARNING: this is not the recommended way to configure the underlying
      services that this charm installs and is used at the user's own risk.
      This option is mainly provided as a stop-gap for users that either
      want to test the effect of modifying some config or who have found
      a critical bug in the way the charm has configured their services
      and need it fixed immediately. We ask that whenever this is used,
      that the user consider opening a bug on this charm at
      http://bugs.launchpad.net/charms providing an explanation of why the
      config was needed so that we may consider it for inclusion as a
      natively supported config in the the charm.
  auth-supported:
    type: string
    default: cephx
    description: |
      Which authentication flavour to use.
      .
      Valid options are "cephx" and "none". If "none" is specified,
      keys will still be created and deployed so that it can be
      enabled later.
  monitor-secret:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      The Ceph secret key used by Ceph monitors. This value will become the
      mon.key. To generate a suitable value use:
      .
        ceph-authtool /dev/stdout --name=mon. --gen-key
      .
      If left empty, a secret key will be generated.
      .
      NOTE: Changing this configuration after deployment is not supported and
      new service units will not be able to join the cluster.
  monitor-count:
    type: int
    default: 3
    description: |
      Number of ceph-mon units to wait for before attempting to bootstrap the
      monitor cluster. For production clusters the default value of 3 ceph-mon
      units is normally a good choice.
      .
      For test and development environments you can enable single-unit
      deployment by setting this to 1.
      .
      NOTE: To establish quorum and enable partition tolerance a odd number of
      ceph-mon units is required.
  monitor-hosts:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      A space-separated list of ceph mon hosts to use. This field is only used
      to migrate an existing cluster to a juju-managed solution and should
      otherwise be left unset.
  expected-osd-count:
    type: int
    default: 0
    description: |
      Number of OSDs expected to be deployed in the cluster. This value is used
      for calculating the number of placement groups on pool creation. The
      number of placement groups for new pools are based on the actual number
      of OSDs in the cluster or the expected-osd-count, whichever is greater
      A value of 0 will cause the charm to only consider the actual number of
      OSDs in the cluster.
  pgs-per-osd:
    type: int
    default: 100
    description: |
      The number of placement groups per OSD to target. It is important to
      properly size the number of placement groups per OSD as too many
      or too few placement groups per OSD may cause resource constraints and
      performance degradation. This value comes from the recommendation of
      the Ceph placement group calculator (http://ceph.com/pgcalc/) and
      recommended values are:
      .
      100 - If the cluster OSD count is not expected to increase in the
            foreseeable future.
      200 - If the cluster OSD count is expected to increase (up to 2x) in the
            foreseeable future.
      300 - If the cluster OSD count is expected to increase between 2x and 3x
            in the foreseeable future.
  ceph-public-network:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      The IP address and netmask of the public (front-side) network (e.g.,
      192.168.0.0/24)
      .
      If multiple networks are to be used, a space-delimited list of a.b.c.d/x
      can be provided.
  ceph-cluster-network:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      The IP address and netmask of the cluster (back-side) network (e.g.,
      192.168.0.0/24)
      .
      If multiple networks are to be used, a space-delimited list of a.b.c.d/x
      can be provided.
  prefer-ipv6:
    type: boolean
    default: False
    description: |
      If True enables IPv6 support. The charm will expect network interfaces
      to be configured with an IPv6 address. If set to False (default) IPv4
      is expected.
      .
      NOTE: these charms do not currently support IPv6 privacy extension. In
      order for this charm to function correctly, the privacy extension must be
      disabled and a non-temporary address must be configured/available on
      your network interface.
  sysctl:
    type: string
    default: '{ kernel.pid_max : 2097152, vm.max_map_count : 524288,
                kernel.threads-max: 2097152 }'
    description: |
      YAML-formatted associative array of sysctl key/value pairs to be set
      persistently. By default we set pid_max, max_map_count and 
      threads-max to a high value to avoid problems with large numbers (>20)
      of OSDs recovering. very large clusters should set those values even
      higher (e.g. max for kernel.pid_max is 4194303).
  customize-failure-domain:
    type: boolean
    default: false
    description: |
      Setting this to true will tell Ceph to replicate across Juju's
      Availability Zone instead of specifically by host.
  nagios_context:
    type: string
    default: "juju"
    description: |
      Used by the nrpe-external-master subordinate charm.
      A string that will be prepended to instance name to set the hostname
      in nagios. So for instance the hostname would be something like:
      .
          juju-myservice-0
      .
      If you're running multiple environments with the same services in them
      this allows you to differentiate between them.
  nagios_servicegroups:
    type: string
    default: ""
    description: |
      A comma-separated list of nagios servicegroups. If left empty, the
      nagios_context will be used as the servicegroup.
  use-direct-io:
    type: boolean
    default: True
    description: Configure use of direct IO for OSD journals.
  default-rbd-features:
    type: int
    default:
    description: |
      Restrict the rbd features used to the specified level. If set, this will
      inform clients that they should set the config value `rbd default
      features`, for example:
      .
        rbd default features = 1
      .
      This needs to be set to 1 when deploying a cloud with the nova-lxd
      hypervisor.
  no-bootstrap:
    type: boolean
    default: False
    description: |
      Causes the charm to not do any of the initial bootstrapping of the
      Ceph monitor cluster. This is only intended to be used when migrating
      from the ceph all-in-one charm to a ceph-mon / ceph-osd deployment.
      Refer to the Charm Deployment guide at https://docs.openstack.org/charm-deployment-guide/latest/
      for more information.
